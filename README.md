# Keylogger
It will read all you keystrokes and record them in a '.txt' file.
I added the extension '.pyw' which will help the program to run on the background. You are free to change it to '.py' if you want to keep the prompt open.

Modules used: Datetime, keyboard

Note: Antivirus programs might interfere with the keylogger
