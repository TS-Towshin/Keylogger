# Keylogger
It will read all your keystrokes and record them in a '.txt' file.
I added the extension '.pyw' which will help the program to run on the background. You are free to change it to '.py' if you want to keep the prompt open.
<br><br/>
Modules used: Datetime, keyboard
<br><br/>
Note: Antivirus programs might interfere with the keylogger<br>If you want to stop the keylogger then go to the task bar, select 'python.exe' and right click. Now select 'end task' or just restart the device.
